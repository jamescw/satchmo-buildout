A buildout.cfg for creating an environment for developing on Satchmo.

This is an attempt to recreate the virtualenv example in the post:

Still having difficulty working out what dependancies go in the "parts" and what goes in the "eggs" section.

If I can nail it, it will be a great help for beginners of satchmo, not to mention useful for anyone wanting to create a satchmo install quickly on any machine.

I used these projects to try and work out how to construct my buildout.cfg
